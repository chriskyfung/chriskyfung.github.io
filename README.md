## 🏡 Chris KY FUNG's GitHub Page

This site is a new version of my old site “Blog of a POLIDA post-grad II .” which was hosting on Wix.com. Now it has been moved to the GitHub page. It should deliver a much faster page loading speed and a nicer display of codes. I hope you will better enjoy my content.

## 🌳 Vision

Computer programming is one important ability necessary for scientific research. It is not only useful in data analytics and simulations, but also helpful to automate and streamline our daily and research tasks.

I hope we share ideas, codes, tips here, and collaborate to make our programming tasks easier soon.

## 💗 Like my stuff?

Would you like to buy me a coffee? I would really appreciate it if you could support me for my R&D projects.
