This repository contains the source code for my personal blog, hosted on GitHub Pages. It is built with Jekyll and features a custom, AMP-first theme to ensure a fast, mobile-friendly experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Static Site:** Generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for performance and security.
- **AMP First:** Built from the ground up to be fully AMP-compliant.
- **Automated Deployments:** Deployed automatically via GitHub Actions.
- **Content Management:** Managed using [Front Matter CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/) within VS Code for a streamlined authoring experience.
- **Optimized Build:** Uses a Gulp-based workflow for post-processing, including AMP optimization and HTML minification.

## üöÄ Development

This project uses a combination of Ruby (for Jekyll) and Node.js (for build tools). For detailed setup and development instructions, please see the **[Development Guide](./_docs/development.md)**.
