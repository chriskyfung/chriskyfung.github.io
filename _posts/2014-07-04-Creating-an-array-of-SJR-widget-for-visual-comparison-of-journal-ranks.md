Impact factor is very useful for us to rank SCI journals. However, I can't access Journal Citation Report (JCR) outside my campus. The browsed section losses if the session time out or restart the browser. Rather than search the information of a journal on the JCR site every time, I made a list to store the journal names and their impact factors in an excel file.  Although I can find the impact factors of the journals that I commonly read, the table does not help me to remember the ranks easily.

SCImago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) is an alternative journal rank service. It does not require logon or subscription, so I can access the journal rank at anytime and anywhere. Instead of impact factor, SJR offer indicators, such as H-index, SJR indicator, cites per document, etc.

What I want to introduce today is the SJR widget. I have found that SJR provides an indicator widget for us to insert it in our own HTML web page. Today, I created a page and an array of the widget to show the citation indicators of my commonly read journals together, as shown in the picture above.

Now I feel more sensitive to remember the journal ranks. How do you think about this method?
