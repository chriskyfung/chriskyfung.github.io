Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the countless articles you want to read but can never find the time?
Whether you're a fan of **[Pocket]** or **[Instapaper]**, I truly believe these read-later apps are a must for anyone eager to learn and absorb new information.

I've been a loyal user of Pocket since it was originally called *Read It Later*.
It helps me save articles from the web and read them whenever I get a free moment.

But with new apps like **[Omnivore]** popping up, it might be worth considering a switch.
In this post, Iâ€™ll compare Pocket and Omnivore to help you decide if Omnivore could be a suitable replacement for Pocket.

## Why I Loved Pocket

Iâ€™ve been using Pocket for over 10 years and have watched it evolve.
Itâ€™s really convenient and functional. I honestly think [Pocket Premium][Pocket Premium] is worth paying for.

### What I Love

- **Cross-Platform Use**: Pocket works seamlessly across iOS, Android, and the Web, allowing you to [save and read your articles][How to Save to Pocket] anywhere.
- **Listen to Articles**: Pocket makes use of robust text-to-speech (TTS) engines on iOS and Android, supporting a wide variety of languages. You can [use the TTS feature to listen to your articles][Listening to articles in Pocket with Text-to-Speech].
- **Offline Access**: Great for reading on the move, Pocket lets you [access over a thousand articles offline][Using Pocket offline].

Pocket is a great app, at least for now. But if you're a heavy user like me, you might find that Pocket doesnâ€™t quite meet the needs of serious readers.

[Using Pocket offline](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-pocket-offline)

### What I Don't Like

- **Search Functionality**: Pocketâ€™s search feature in the free account is fairly simple, missing filters or advanced operators to help narrow down your results. To access [Full-Text Search and Advanced Search Operators][Pocket Premium Full-Text Search], you'll need to upgrade to Pocket Premium.
- **Undesired Recent Changes**: Mozilla rolled out several updates to Pocket in 2024, but I found some of the changes quite disappointing. For example, the article link shared now directs to a preview page on *[getpocket.com]* rather than the original webpage. Also, the [bulk editing feature][Bulk Editing Pocket] has been removed from the search result pages.

Overall, Pocket's updates have been slow in coming over the past few years, and it's left me feeling a bit let down. I'm eager to find new features and alternative ways to make my reading and note-taking more efficient.

## What is Omnivore?

Omnivore is an open-source read-later app that aims to provide a robust alternative to Pocket.
While still under development, it shows a lot of promise.

**Current State**: Omnivore boasts [many attractive features](https://docs.omnivore.app/), but it also has its share of bugs and limitations, which weâ€™ll explore in detail.

**Limitations**:

- **Search Functionality**: The search feature is currently buggy, [especially when it comes to handling Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) articles][Issue-3706], which can be quite frustrating for users from East Asia.
- **Listen to Articles**: At the moment, only Omnivore for iOS can [read articles aloud with Text-to-Speech (TTS)][Omnivore's Text to Speech], and it currently supports 11 languages like English and Mandarin Chinese.

- **Stability and Performance**: Experiences some crashes and client-side exceptions from time to time, which can disrupt the user experience.
- **Integrations**: Has limited integration options and a complicated [webhook][Omnivore's Webhooks] setup, which can be frustrating for those who aren't tech-savvy.

### Who Should Try Omnivore?

Even with its limitations, Omnivore is an appealing option for specific users:

- **iOS Users**: Omnivore works well on iOS devices.

## Conclusion

Omnivore has the potential to become a leading read-later app.
Its open-source nature and unique features make it a strong contender.

However, it still has several issues that need addressed, such as stability, search functionality, and language support.
While Omnivore may eventually replace Pocket, itâ€™s not quite there yet.

If you fit the ideal user profile mentioned above, itâ€™s worth giving Omnivore a try.
Otherwise, you might want to wait until it becomes more stable and user-friendly.
