In this article, we will go through the lab **GSP322** _[Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/12068?parent=catalog)_, which is an [expert-level](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/128) exercise on Qwiklabs. You will need to set up firewall rules to configure a simple environment securely that only allow SSH to the bastion via IAP.

**The challenge contains 6 required tasks:**

1. Remove the overly permissive rules
2. Start the bastion host instance
3. Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add a network tag on `bastion`
4. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add a network tag on `juice-shop`
5. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from the `acme-mgmt-subnet` network address and add a network tag on `juice-shop`
6. SSH to bastion host via IAP and `juice-shop` via `bastion`

## 1. Remove the overly permissive rules

This task is very simple. You only need the open-access firewall rules.

1. In the Cloud Console, navigate to **Menu** > **VPC Network** > **Firewall**
2. Check the box next to the rule named `open-access`.
3. Click on **DELETE** to remove it.

## 2. Start the bastion host instance

1. In the Cloud Console, navigate to **Menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**
2. Check the box next to the instance named `bastion`.
3. Click on **Start** to run the instance.

## 3. Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add network tag on bastion

### Add network tag on bastion

1. On the VM instances page, click on the name of the **bastion** instance.
2. Click **EDIT** on the details page.
3. Add `bastion` to the **Network tags** field.
4. Scroll to the button of the page and click **Save**.

### Create firewall rule to allow SSH from the IAP service

Read [**Using IAP for TCP forwarding**](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding#create-firewall-rule) in the Google Cloud Documentation before you create the firewall rule.

1. Go back to the Firewall Rules page, and click **Create firewall rule**.
2. Configure the following settings:

   |  Field    |   Value    |
   | ---       | ---        |
   | Name | e.g. `allow-ssh-from-iap` |
   | Direction of traffic | Ingress |
   | Targets | Specified target tags |
   | Target tags | `bastion` |
   | Source IP ranges | `35.235.240.0/20` |
   | Protocols and ports | Select **TCP** and enter `22` to allow SSH |

## 4. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add network tag on juice-shop

### Create firewall rule to allow HTTP traffic to juice-shop

1. On the Firewall Rules page, and click **Create firewall rule**.
2. Configure the following settings:

   |  Field    |   Value    |
   | ---       | ---        |
   | Name | e.g. `allow-http-ingress` |
   | Direction of traffic | Ingress |
   | Targets | Specified target tags |
   | Target tags | `juice-shop` |
   | Source IP ranges | `0.0.0.0/0` |
   | Protocols and ports | Select **TCP** and enter `80` to allow HTTP |

### Add network tag on juice-shop

1. On the VM instances page, click on the name of the **juice-shop** instance.
2. Click **EDIT** on the details page.
3. Add `juice-shop` to the **Network tags** field.
4. Scroll to the button of the page and click **Save**.

## 5. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address and add network tag on juice-shop

1. Navigate to **VPC network** > **VPC networks**.
2. Copy the IP address range of the `acme-mgmt-subnet`.
3. Go back to the Firewall Rules page, and click **Create firewall rule**.
4. Configure the following settings:

   |  Field    |   Value    |
   | ---       | ---        |
   | Name | e.g. `allow-ssh-from-mgmt-subnet` |
   | Direction of traffic | Ingress |
   | Targets | Specified target tags |
   | Target tags | `bastion` and `juice-shop` |
   | Source IP ranges | _IP address range of your aceme-mgmt-subnet_ |
   | Protocols and ports | Select **TCP** and enter `22` to allow SSH |

## 6. SSH to bastion host via IAP and juice-shop via bastion

After configuring the firewall rules, try to verify the environment via the bastion.

1. Navigate to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
2. Copy the Internal IP of the **juice-shop** instance.
3. Click on the SSH button in the row of the **bastion** instance.
4. In the SSH console, access the juice-shop from the bastion using the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh <internal-IP-of-juice-shop>
   ```

   (Remember to REPLACE `<internal-IP-of-juice-shop>` with the copied IP address)
