Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes (K8s) is an emerging application architecture for deploying, scaling and, managing distributed applications. The challenge lab **GSP304** _"[Build and Deploy a Docker Image to a Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1738?parent=catalog)"_ is a test to assess the essential professional skills in deploying your application on GKE.

## Brief Introduction of Challenge Scenario

When you open the page of this lab on Qwiklabs, you can find the task requirements by click the green activity tracker (on the top right of the page) to expand the score box.

The screenshot above shows that there are 4 steps required for completing this lab. Combining with the instruction details, they are translated to the following mission statements.

1. Use the sample application and Docker configuration to build a Docker image, and push the image to the gcr.io repository with a `v1` tag.

2. A new Kubernetes cluster called `echo-cluster` exists.

3. The application called `echo-app` has been deployed to the cluster.

4. The service called `echo-web` exists that responds to requests like Echo-app.

## Create a Kubernetes Cluster

In the web console, navigate to **Kubernetes Engine** > **Clusters**. Click **Create a cluster** with:

- Cluster name: `echo-cluster`
- Num of Nodes: 2
- Machine type: N1-standard-2

I recommend starting from preparing the hardware because the process takes time. You can continue doing the steps in the next section. The cluster should be ready when you finish building and pushing the docker image to Container Registry.

## Build a Docker Image of Sample Application

If you do not remember how to build a docker image on GCP, I recommend you revise the lab _"[Introduction to Docker](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1029?parent=catalog)"_ before you start.

1. (_Optional_)  While the provisioning of lab resources, you may click the link below the timer to download the given archive called `echo-web.tar.gz`. You may spend some time studying the contained files in your local storage.

   {% include picture.html width="350" height="347"
   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step1-Download-Sample-Application-Files.png" alt="Download Sample Application with Docker Configuration" class="shadow-none text-center" %}

{:start="2"}
2. The `echo-web.tar.gz` file has already been copied to a Google Cloud Storage bucket called `gs://[PROJECT_ID]` during the lab provision. Navigate to **_Storage_**, confirm the file exists in the bucket. Then, click the file name and copy the URL of the file from its detail page.

   {% include picture.html width="682" height="296"
   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step2-echo-web-tar-gz-in-cloud-storage.png" alt="Look for the given archive in Cloud Storage" %}

{:start="3"}
3. Open a Cloud Shell, use the following commands to copy and unzip `echo-web.tar.gz` to the shell environment:

   ```bash
   export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')
   gsutil cp gs://${PROJECT_ID}/echo-web.tar.gz .
   tar -xvzf echo-web.tar.gz
   ```

4. Build a docker image of the sample application with a tag called `v1`, and push the image to Google Container Registry,

   ```bash
   docker build -t echo-app:v1 .
   docker tag echo-app:v1 gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/echo-app:v1
   docker push gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/echo-app:v1
   ```

5. In the web console, navigate to **Container Registry** > **Images** to confirm the docker image has been pushed to the cloud repositories.

   {% include picture.html width="569" height="278" img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step3-echo-app-image-in-container-registry.png" alt="Confirm your docker image existing in Google Container Registry" class="text-center" %}

Next, you need to deploy the application to the Kubernetes Cluster. There are two ways to do this: (1) deploy using the web console, and (2) deploy using Cloud Shell. You can choose either way to finish the lab.

## Deploy the Application to the Kubernetes Cluster Using Web Console (Method #1)

1. On the Container Registry page, click the image name **echo-app**. There should be an image version with the tag `v1`. Click the three-dots icon (<i class='fas fa-ellipsis-v'></i>) and select **Deploy to GKE**.

   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step4-deploy-docker-image-in-container-registry.png" alt="Deploy an image to GKE using web console" %}

{:start="2"}
2. The web console will be redirected to _**Kubernetes Engine**_ > **Create a deployment** dialog,<br>

   {% include picture.html width="682" height="651"
   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step5-create-a-deployment-to-GKE.png" alt="select a container image in Create a deployment dialog" %}

   Click **CONTINUE**.

{:start="3"}
3. In the Configuration section, enter `echo-app` as the application name and choose `echo-cluster` as the cluster in which the deployment will be created.<br>

   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step6-create-a-deployment-to-GKE-configuration.png" alt="edit configuration in Create a deployment dialog" %}

   Click **CREATE NEW CLUSTER**.

{:start="4"}
4. Navigate to _**Kubernetes Engine > Workload**_ page, wait until the status of the deployment becomes **OK**.

   {% include picture.html width="682" height="319"
   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step7-deployed-echo-app.png" alt="Confirm the deployment status" %}

{:start="5"}
5. Click the name **echo-app**, then click **Expose** displayed at the top right corner of the Deployment Details page to create a service for the deployment.

   {% include picture.html width="682" height="420"
   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step8-details-of-echo-app.png" alt="Snapshot of Deploymemt Details page" %}

{:start="6"}
6. In the **Expose a deployment** dialog, configure the service with a new port mapping as below:

   - Port: `80`
   - Target port: `8000`
   - Protocol: `TCP`
   - Service type: `Load balancer`
   - Service name: `echo-web`

      {% include picture.html width="499" height="589"
      img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step9-Port-mapping-with-Load-balancer.png" alt="Snapshot of Expost a deployment dialog" %}

   Click **Expose** to create the service.

   {% include picture.html width="682" height="488"
   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step10-Service-details-of-echo-web.png" alt="Service details page of the deployed GKE service" %}

{:start="7"}
7. In the service details, copy and open the IP address of the external endpoints in a new tab of your browser. The sample application should look like this:

   {% include picture.html width="403" height="172"
   img="qwiklabs/qwiklabs-GSP304-step11-deployed-echo-web.png" alt="Snapshot of the deployed echo-web application" class="text-center" %}

## Deploy the Application to the Kubernetes Cluster Using Cloud Shell (Method #2)

Alternatively, you can deploy the application using cloud shell instead.
After creating your cluster, you need to get authentication credentials to interact with the cluster.

To authenticate the cluster run the following command,

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials echo-cluster
```

Run the following `kubectl run` command in Cloud Shell to create a new Deployment `echo-app` from the `echo-app` container image with opening TCP port 8000:

```bash
kubectl run echo-app --image=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/echo-app:v1 --port 8000
```

Now create a Kubernetes Service, which is a Kubernetes resource that lets you expose your application (that responds on **port 8000**) to external traffic that responds to normal web requests on **port 80**, by running the following `kubectl expose` command:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment echo-app --name echo-web \
   --type LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8000
```

Inspect the `echo-web` Service by running kubectl get:

```bash
kubectl get service echo-web
```

Copy and open the IP address of the external endpoints in a new tab of your browser, the sample application should look like:<br>

Congratulations! You should accomplish the lab if you follow the above steps.

[Next lab]({% post_url qwiklabs/logbooks/2019-09-27-Scale-Out-and-Update-a-Containerized-Application-on-a-Kubernetes-Cluster %}) will continue this exercise and need to update the running `echo-app` application in the `echo-web` deployment from the v1 to the v2.
