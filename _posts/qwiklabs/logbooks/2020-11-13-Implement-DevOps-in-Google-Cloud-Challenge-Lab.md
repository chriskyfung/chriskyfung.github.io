In this article, we will go through the lab **GSP330** _[Implement DevOps in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/13287?parent=catalog)_, which is an [expert-level](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/141) exercise on Qwiklabs. You will practice the skills in implementing a continuous deployment pipeline using the Jenkins build and deployment automation tool.

**Topics tested**:

- Use Jenkins console logs to resolve application deployment issues.
- Deploy and a development update to a sample application for Jenkins to deploy using a development pipeline.
- Deploy and test a Kubernetes Canary deployment for a sample application.
- Push the Canary application branch to master and confirm this triggers a production pipeline update.

## Task 1: Configure a Jenkins pipeline for continuous deployment to Kubernetes Engine

### Inspect Provisioned Resources

1. In the Cloud Console, navigate to **Kubernetes Engine** > **Clusters** to inspect the provisioned cluster named `jenkins-cd`.

2. Navigate to **Source Repositories**, click on `sample-app` and review the **Jenkinsfile** in the root of that repository.

3. Also, review the YAML files for the three types of deployment (production, canary, and dev) in the `sample-app/k8s` directory.

4. Navigate to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**, click on the **SSH** button of the instance named `kraken-jumphost`.

5. In the SSH window, run the following command to configure the compute zone:

   ```bash
   gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b
   ```

6. (Optional) confirm that your cluster is running by executing the following commands:

   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters list
   kubectl cluster-info
   ```

### Install and Setup Helm

1. You will use Helm to install Jenkins from the Charts repository. Helm is a package manager that makes it easy to configure and deploy Kubernetes applications. To install Helm, run the following commands to fetch the Helm installer script, and then execute it locally.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3
   chmod 700 get_helm.sh
   ./get_helm.sh
   ```

2. Setting up and updating Helm by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
   helm repo update
   ```

### Configure and Install Jenkins

1. Use git to clone the lab's sample code:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes.git
   ```

2. Change to the following directory:

   ```bash
   cd continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes
   ```

3. To configure and install Jenkins, run the following command to deploy with the Helm CLI.

   ```bash
   helm install cd stable/jenkins -f jenkins/values.yaml --version 1.2.2 --wait
   ```

   This command may take several minutes to complete.

4. Once the command completed, ensure the Jenkins pod goes to the Running state and the container is in the READY state:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   Example Output:

   {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-cd-jenkins-pod-ready.jpg" width="623" height="38" class="ml-li" %}

{:start="5"}
5. The Jenkins chart will automatically create an admin password for you. To retrieve it, run:

   ```bash
   printf $(kubectl get secret cd-jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo
   ```

### Connect to Jenkins

1. Go back to the Cloud Console, then open a cloud shell and run the following command to get the credentials for your cluster:

   ```bash
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials jenkins-cd --zone us-east1-b
   ```

2. Run the following command to setup port forwarding to the Jenkins UI from the Cloud Shell.

   ```bash
   export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/component=jenkins-master" -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=cd" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
   kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:8080 >> /dev/null &
   ```

   (You don't need to configure the Jenkins service account because it has already been created during provisioning.)

3. To get to the Jenkins user interface, click on the Web Preview button in the cloud shell, then click **Preview on port 8080**.

   {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-jenkins-login-page.png" width="1024" height="576" class="ml-li" %}

{:start="4"}
4. You should now be able to log in with the username `admin` and your auto-generated password.

### Clone the Sample App Repository and Create the Production Namespace

1. Go back to the SSH window, clone the `sample-app` source code from the Cloud Source Repository by running the following command:

   ```bash
   gcloud source repos clone sample-app --project=<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
   ```

   _Remember to replace `<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>` with your GCP project ID_

2. Change to the sample application directory and then create the Kubernetes namespace to logically isolate the deployment:

   ```bash
   cd sample-app
   kubectl create ns production
   ```

### Creating the Jenkins Pipeline

#### Adding your service account credentials

Configure your credentials to allow Jenkins to access the code repository. Jenkins will use your cluster's service account credentials in order to download code from the Cloud Source Repositories.

1. In the Jenkins user interface, click **Manage Jenkins** in the left navigation then click **Manage Credentials**.

2. Click **Jenkins**

3. Click **Global credentials (unrestricted)**.

4. Click **Add Credentials** in the left navigation.

5. Select **Google Service Account from metadata** from the **Kind** drop-down and click **OK**.

#### Configure the Jenkins job

After configuring your credentials, follow these steps to configure a Pipeline job.

1. Click **Jenkins** to return the welcome page.

2. Reload the page a few times until you see a pipeline job named **sample-app** in the Jenkins user interface.

   (If you fail to get any job, click **Jenkins** > **New Item** in the left navigation to create the multibranch pipeline.)

3. Click on the job name of **sample-app**.

   {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-jenkins-sample-app-pipeline-job.png" width="1024" height="277" class="ml-li" %}

{:start="4"}
4. Click **Configure** in the left pane.

5. In the configuration page, enter `sample-app` as the Display Name in the General section.

   {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-jenkins-sample-app-job-configure-general-tab.png" width="1024" height="430" class="ml-li" %}

{:start="6"}
6. In the Branch Sources section, click on **Add source** and choose **Git** from the dropdown menu.

7. Copy the Cloud Source URL of the **sample-app** repository to the **Project Repository** field. The URL should look like this:

   ```url
   https://source.developers.google.com/p/<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>/r/sample-app
   ```

   Select the service account for your GCP project from the **Credentials** dropdown list.

   {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-jenkins-sample-app-job-branch-sources-config.png" width="946" height="524" class="ml-li" %}

{:start="8"}
8. Check **Periodically if not otherwise run** in the **Scan Multibranch Pipeline Trigger** section, and then select **1 minute** for the interval.

   {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-jenkins-sample-app-job-build-and-trigger-config.png " width="944" height="354" class="ml-li" %}

{:start="9"}
9. Scroll to the bottom and click on **Save**.

10. If you correctly configured the pipeline, you will see **Finished: SUCCESS** at the end of the Scan Multibranch Pipeline Log.

    {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-jenkins-sample-app-scan-multibranch-pipeline-log.png" width="1024" height="690" class="ml-li" %}

### Examine the Console Output from the Jenkins Pipeline

1. Click on **sample-app >> master** under Build Executor Status in the left pane, then click on the job under Build History.

   {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-jenkins-build-master.png" width="739" height="560" class="ml-li" %}

{:start="2"}
2. Click **Console Output** in the left navigation to monitor the build process.

   {% include picture.html img="qwiklabs/gsp330-jenkins-console-output.png" width="1024" height="809" class="ml-li" %}

   This process takes about five minutes to complete.

## Task 2: Push an update to the application to a development branch

1. Go back to the SSH window, run the following command to create a development branch in the `sample-app` directory.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-feature
   ```

2. Open the **main.go** file with `vi`, `nano`, or the Cloud Shell Editor.

3. Update the version in the following line:

   ```go
   const version string = "1.0.0"
   ```

   to

   ```go
   const version string = "2.0.0"
   ```

   then save the change.

4. Open the **html.go** file and change the two instances of `<div class="card blue">` to `<div class="card orange">`.

5. Commit and push your changes by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git add Jenkinsfile html.go main.go
   git commit -m "Version 2.0.0"
   git push origin new-feature
   ```

6. Go to the Jenkins user interface, click **Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now** if you want to trigger the build immediately.

## Task 3: Push a Canary deployment to the production namespace

1. Go back to the SSH window, run the following command to create a canary branch in the `sample-app` directory.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b canary
   ```

2. Merge the change from the development branch:

   ```bash
   git merge new-feature
   ```

3. Push the canary to the Git server:

   ```bash
   git push origin canary
   ```

4. Go to the Jenkins user interface, click **Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now** if you want to trigger the build immediately.

## Task 4: Promote the Canary Deployment to production

1. Go back to the SSH window, run the following commands to merge the canary branch, and push it to the Git server.

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge canary
   git push origin master
   ```

2. Go to the Jenkins user interface, click **Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now** if you want to trigger the build immediately.
