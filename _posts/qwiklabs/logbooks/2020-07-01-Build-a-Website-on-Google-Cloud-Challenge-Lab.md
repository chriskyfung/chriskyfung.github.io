In this article, we will go through the lab **GSP319** _[Build a Website on Google Cloud: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/11765?parent=catalog)_, which is an [advanced-level](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/115) exercise on Qwiklabs. You will practice the skills and knowledge for website architectures available to be scalable with microservices on Google Kubernetes Engine.

**The challenge contains 6 required tasks:**

1. Download the monolith code and build your container
1. Create a kubernetes cluster and deploy the application
1. Create a containerized version of orders and product 1. Microservices
1. Deploy the new microservices
1. Create a containerized version of the Frontend 1. microservice
1. Deploy the Frontend microservice

## Task 1: Download the monolith code and build your container

**Hint**: Refer and modify the procedures in the first two sections of the lab [Deploy Your Website on Cloud Run](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10445?parent=catalog)

First of all, you need to clone the [project repository](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/monolith-to-microservices) from GitHub to your Cloud Shell environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/googlecodelabs/monolith-to-microservices.git
```

Run the `setup.sh` to install the NodeJS dependencies for the monolith code

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices
./setup.sh
```

Before building the Docker container, you can preview the monolith application on **port 8080** by running the following commands to start the web server:

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/monolith
npm start
```

Next, enable the Cloud Build API and submit a build named `fancytest` with a version of `1.0.0` using the following commands:

```bash
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/fancytest:1.0.0 .
```

In the Cloud Console, navigate to **Cloud Run** and wait for the successful build of the container.

## Task 2: Create a kubernetes cluster and deploy the application

**Hint**: Refer to in the lab [Deploy, Scale, and Update Your Website on Google Kubernetes Engine](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10470?parent=catalog)

**Make sure that you:**

- create the resources in the `us-central1-a` zone, and
- the cluster is named `fancy-cluster`.

Use the following commands to set the default zone and create the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud container clusters create fancy-cluster --num-nodes 3
```

After the cluster is ready, you need to deploy the application. Make sure that you

- name the deployment to be `fancytest`,
- expose the service on port 80, and
- map it to port 8080.

Run the following commands:

```bash
kubectl create deployment fancytest --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/fancytest:1.0.0
kubectl expose deployment fancytest --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
```

Wait till the GKE creates an external IP and a Load Balancer for the application.

## Task 3: Create a containerized version of your Microservices

**Hint**: Refer to the lab [Migrating a Monolithic Website to Microservices on Google Kubernetes Engine](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/11953?parent=catalog)

**Make sure that you:**

- submit a build named "orders" with a version of "1.0.0", and
- submit a build named "products" with a version of "1.

Run the following commands to build your Docker container for the **Orders Microservice** and push it to the gcr.io:

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/orders
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/orders:1.0.0 .
```

Similarly, repeat the step for the **Products Microservice**:

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/products
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/products:1.0.0 .
```

## Task 4: Deploy the new microservices

**Make sure that you:**

- name the deployment to be "orders" and "products", and
- expose the services on port 80.

Run the following commands to deploy the **Orders Microservice**:

```bash
kubectl create deployment orders --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/orders:1.0.0
kubectl expose deployment orders --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8081
```

Run the following commands to deploy the **Products Microservice**:

```bash
kubectl create deployment products --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/products:1.0.0
kubectl expose deployment products --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8082
```

Wait till the GKE creates external IPs for the "orders" and "products" deployments.

## Task 5: Configure the Frontend microservice

Use the `nano` editor to replace the local URLs with the IP addresses of the new microservices:

Use the `nano` editor to edit the config file in the frontend microservice codebase:

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/react-app
nano .env
```

Replace `<ORDERS_IP_ADDRESS>` and `<PRODUCTS_IP_ADDRESS>` with the Orders and Product microservice IP addresses, respectively.

```bash
REACT_APP_ORDERS_URL=http://<ORDERS_IP_ADDRESS>/api/orders
REACT_APP_PRODUCTS_URL=http://<PRODUCTS_IP_ADDRESS>/api/products
```

Save the file and rebuild the frontend app before containerizing it:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Task 6: Create a containerized version of the Frontend microservice

**Make sure that you:**

- submit a build that is named `frontend`
- with a version of `1.0.0`.

```bash
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/frontend
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/frontend:1.0.0 .
```

## Task 7: Deploy the Frontend microservice

Similar to Task 4, use `kubectl` commands to deploy the Frontend microservice:

```bash
kubectl create deployment frontend --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/frontend:1.0.0

kubectl expose deployment frontend --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
```

**Congratulations! You completed this challenge lab.**

## Summary

Most steps in the exercise are identical to those in the lab **Migrating a Monolithic Website to Microservices on Google Kubernetes Engine**. To complete this challenge, make sure you carefully replace the cluster and deployment names with the specified ones. If you still have questions, you can leave a comment below.
