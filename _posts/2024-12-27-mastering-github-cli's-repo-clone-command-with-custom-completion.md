excerpt: Unlocking the full potential of GitHub CLI's `gh repo clone` command with custom bash completion
---

In today's fast-paced development environment, efficiency is key. The GitHub CLI is a powerful tool that streamlines interactions with GitHub directly from your terminal. One command that developers frequently use is `gh repo clone`, which allows users to quickly clone repositories.

Despite its utility, I found myself fumbling with repository names and options until I discovered a secret weapon: custom completion.

As a developer constantly in the trenches of code, I've always sought ways to streamline my workflow. In this blog post, I'll introduce a custom completion function to enhance your command-line experience.

## The Struggles with `gh repo clone`

While `gh repo clone` is incredibly useful, using it felt like a memory game. I struggled to recall exact repository names, some of those names are a mouthful. Then there were the flags that I could never remember. These tiny hurdles added up, hindering productivity, especially for those who constantly work with multiple repositories.

## Crafting the Custom Completion Function

Driven by the desire for seamless interaction, I embarked on a quest to enhance my command-line experience. Instead of wrestling with repository names and flags, I decided to create a custom completion script for the `gh repo clone` command. The little script is productivity boost:

- **Streamlined Interaction**: Enjoy a smoother interaction with GitHub from the command line, thanks to autocomplections that suggest repositories and flags as I typed.
- **Eased Operations**: No more guessing games; the script remembered the paths and options so I didn’t have to.
- **Efficient Suggestions**: I could focus on coding, knowing the right repositories and flags were just a keystroke away.

Let's look at a practical example:

Imagine typing `gh repo clone` and seeing instant suggestions for repositories and their respective flags. The completion script automatically populates potential options, enabling faster decision-making and execution.

## How To Install

To get started with this custom completion script, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Script**

   First, download the script to your preferred location from [my Gist](https://gist.github.com/chriskyfung/50039cb2a9b586047adc2726085c6280/raw/.bash_profile).

2. **Install the Script**

   Copy the script to your home directory or another preferred location, for example: `~/.gh-repo-clone-completion.bash`.

3. **Configure the Shell**

   Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to enable the script:

   ```bash
   source ~/.gh-repo-clone-completion.bash
   ```

4. **Verify the Setup**

   Type `gh repo clone <TAB><TAB>` in your terminal. If setup correctly, you should see repository suggestions as you type.

   Type `gh repo clone -- <TAB><TAB>` in your terminal. You should see additional `git clone` flags by listing them after `--`.

## Conclusion

Implementing this custom completion function can transform your GitHub CLI experience by making it more efficient and user-friendly. My coding sessions are now more about creativity and less about the little frustrations. I'm excited to share this with you, and I encourage
you to try the script, share feedback and contributions from the developer community to further enhance this tool.

Download the script, experiment with it, and share your experiences. Let’s keep improving our craft together.

Happy coding!
