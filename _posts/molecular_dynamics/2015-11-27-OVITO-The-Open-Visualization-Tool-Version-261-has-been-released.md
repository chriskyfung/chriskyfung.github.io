I do like using [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/) for analysis and visualization of my LAMMPS results.

A new version has been released in this month. You can check out the changes [here](https://www.ovito.org/about/version-history).

*[OVITO]: Open Visualization Tool
*[LAMMPS]: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator
