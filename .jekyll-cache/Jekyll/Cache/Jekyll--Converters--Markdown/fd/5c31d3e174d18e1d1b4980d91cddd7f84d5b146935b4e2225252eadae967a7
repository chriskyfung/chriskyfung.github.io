<p>Recently, I faced a problem to choose a Windows Store app as the default app for a specific file type. The app was not found by using neitherÂ <a href="https://techforluddites.com/windows-10-change-the-default-programs-for-opening-files/">Windows 10â€™s Settings page or the â€œOpen Withâ€ option from the right-click menu of the files</a>. So I need to go for the â€œLook for another app on this PCâ€ and locate where is the program (.exe) file.</p>

<p>Windows typically installs conventional programs toÂ <em>C:\Program Files</em>Â orÂ <em>C:\Program Files (x86)</em>, while it stores the store apps in a different folder calledÂ <strong>WindowsApps</strong>Â under theÂ <strong><em>C:\Program Files</em></strong>Â directory. You can find the folder by enabling the display of hidden files in File Explorer, but Windows will alert that you do not have permission to access the folder. To browser the folder, you mightÂ <a href="https://www.techmesto.com/windows-store-apps-installed-save-data/">change the owner and the permission under its Advanced Security Settings</a>. However, it can turn your system at risk. A better way is to look for the installation path from the Windows Registry.</p>

<h2 id="find-the-key-using-registry-editor">Find the key using Registry Editor</h2>

<p>The Windows Registry contains the keys and values for all store apps, including their installed locations. You can find them by following this procedure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>PressÂ <strong>Start</strong>,Â search forÂ <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-registry-editor-2625150"><em>regedit.exe</em></a> and then open it.<br />
<img src="/images/posts/windows/icon%20of%20regedit.exe.png" alt="icon of regedit.exe" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registry Editor will open.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to <em>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\Packages</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look for the key with the app name, or pressÂ <strong>Ctrl+F</strong>Â to use the â€œFindâ€ dialog for a quick search under the registry tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the app key you found, there should be a subkey calledÂ <code class="highlighter-rouge">PackageID</code>Â and another calledÂ <code class="highlighter-rouge">PackageRootFolder</code>, shown as the example below.<br />
<img src="/images/posts/windows/Example%20registry%20of%20a%20windows%20store%20app.png" alt="Example registry of a windows store app" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double-click the name of the subkeyÂ <code class="highlighter-rouge">PackageRootFolder</code>,Â and copy the value data to the clipboard.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="use-the-open-with-command-to-change-the-default-program-for-the-specific-file-type">Use the â€œOpen Withâ€ command to change the default program for the specific file type</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In File Explorer, right-click on a file whose default program you want to change. SelectÂ <strong>Open With</strong>Â &gt; ChooseÂ <strong>Another App</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scroll down and click onÂ <strong>Look for another app on this PC</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the â€œOpen withâ€¦â€ dialog, paste the copied path to the field â€œ<em>File name:</em>â€ and hit Enter.<br />
<img src="/images/posts/windows/The%20app%20root%20folder%20in%20WindowsApps.jpg" alt="The app root folder in WindowsApps" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The app root folder will open. Find and choose the Program (.exe) file inside the folder and in its subfolders, for the application you want to make as the default.<br />
<img src="/images/posts/windows/The%20draw-io-exe%20under%20WindowsApps.png" alt="The draw.io.exe under WindowsApps" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The specific file type should now associate with the application. You can try to double-click a file to open it with the default program.</p>
